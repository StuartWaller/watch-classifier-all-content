[notes]
neural networks are just matrix multiplications
PyTorch = Python implementation of neural networks
using fastai library | built on top of PyTorch 
fastai provides even higher level abstractions for developers to implement neural networks
without having to get into all the nitty-gritty details

[jupyter notebook environment]
create "code" and "data" folders inside folder called "WatchProj"
zip "images" folder and upload to "data" folder
create new .ipynb notebook in "data" folder to unzip "images.zip" and unzip to "data" folder

**edit Model Classification.ipynb accordingly** 

[local machine]
create "notebooks" folder in "WatchProj" folder, download "Classification Model.ipynb" (from jupyter notebooks environment), and add it to "notebooks" folder
create "models" folder in "WatchProj" folder, download "classifier.pkl" (from jupyter notebooks environment), and add it to "models" folder
